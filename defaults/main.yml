# defaults file for conorsch-env
# If you don't set "conorsch_env_username", the role will assume you want
# to configure the environment for the user you're SSHing in as.
# Normally we'd simply ansible_user_id, but providing the
# "conorsch_env_username" variable allows for overriding, so the role is more flexible.
